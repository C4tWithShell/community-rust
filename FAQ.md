##FAQ


* ### How do I build the plugin from source

This project is built with Maven
Use : `mvn clean package`


* ### Why can't I find the plugin listed in the SonarQube Marketplace ?

It is not listed yet on the MarketPlace
It may finds its way some day when some minimal feedback of its usage proves it working as expected

* ### Can I use this plugin on SonarCloud ?

SonarCloud is a little different to SonarQube in that it doesnâ€™t currently provide the ability to add third-party plugins like `Sonar rust`.

* ### Can I use this plugin on SonarLint ?

Currently `Sonar Rust` is not supported by SonarLint.

You don't : the (free) Community edition v7.9+ is compatible
(and it also works on Commercial editions of SonarQube)

* ### Can I scan my Rust source code within a  CI/CD pipeline ?

There is nothing specific for this plugin. Any CI pipeline which allows a SonarQube analysis can trigger an analysis on a Rust project
The only requirement is that the `Sonar Rust` plugin is installed on your SonarQube instance

* ### How many coding rules / Quality Profiles does this Sonar Rust plugin  provide ?

No Rust rule or Quality profile are defined by this plugin. The plugin only allows to import issues that Clippy has found

Yes, the issues on other languages than Rust will be detected by their respective language analyzer
